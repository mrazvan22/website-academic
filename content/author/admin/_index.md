Email: razvan at csail.mit.edu

I am a postdoctoral researcher at MIT, working with [Polina Golland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/) to develop machine learning algorithms for healthcare applications. I currently work on methods to visualise what black-box classifiers learned, which are very important for debugging classifiers, increasing model performance and building trust in order to deploy such systems to the clinic.

During my PhD, I developed Bayesian statistical models for prediction of Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative diseases. I further co-organised TADPOLE, an international competition that compared 92 algorithms from 33 teams at predicting the evolution of Alzheimer's disease.   

I also have a keen interest in general machine learning and computational intelligence, in order to make computers perform intelligent tasks. 

You can see a complete list of publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AzfoycUAAAAJ) page.

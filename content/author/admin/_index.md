Email: razvan at csail.mit.edu

I am a postdoctoral researcher at MIT, working with Polina Golland to develop machine learning algorithms for quantifying pathologies in the human brain. More precisely, I focus on automatic extraction and quantification of lesions and white matter hyperintensities, which would enable researchers to perform quantitative studies on large populations. This would further enable us to understand the mechanisms underlying these pathologies and to develop effective treatments. 

I also have a keen interest in general machine learning and computational intelligence, in order to make computers perform intelligent tasks. 

You can see a complete list of publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AzfoycUAAAAJ) page.
